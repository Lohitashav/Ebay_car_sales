# Analyzing Used Cars Listing on eBay Kleinanzeigen
This project analyzes a dataset of used car listings from eBay Kleinanzeigen, the classifieds section of the German eBay website. The dataset was originally scraped by a Kaggle user, orgesleka, and is now available on Data.World.

# Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to clean, explore, and derive insights from the dataset. By working with real-world, messy data, this project highlights key data analysis techniques, including:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identifying patterns and trends in the used car market
  
# Dataset Overview
The dataset contains information about various used car listings, including:

- Car models
- Price
- Mileage
- Registration year
- Location
- Ad details

# Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook
  
# Key Highlights
- Insights into pricing trends based on car make and model.
- Analysis of car attributes, such as mileage and registration year, to identify patterns.
- Identification and handling of outliers and anomalies in the dataset.
- Cleaning of erroneous or inconsistent data entries.
  
# Instructions for Running the Notebook
- Download the dataset from Data.World (if not already included).
- Ensure you have Python installed with the required libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.).
- Open the Jupyter Notebook and run each cell sequentially.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to work with real-world datasets and derive meaningful insights. It showcases data cleaning and analysis skills, making it a valuable learning experience for anyone interested in data science or analytics.
